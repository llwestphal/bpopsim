This program runs a biological population simulation based on a novel algorithm to choose cells for mutation. It keeps track of an asexual population of evolving cells based on fitness and lineage.

The program calculates genotype frequencies on the fly. After the simulation, currently there are options to output the raw genotype frequencies, generate a muller matrix file for plotting, and calculating the max divergence between adjacent sweeping mutations. More calculations are being added.

If you want to know what a centered Muller plot looks like it is our logo.

The application can either be built using the make files in Linux and OSX or using the Xcode project in OSX
